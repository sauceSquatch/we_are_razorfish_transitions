# We Are Razorfish prototype
Example of a and experience that is intended to run fullscreen. Auto plays each video for a duration then transitions to the next.

Currently it does not run a server but does use livereload, I have been using MAMP and just pointing it at the folder instead of setting up a node server, it was just quicker to prototype for me.

### install and run

`npm install`

`gulp`

### TO DO
- randomize people array
- re-pull json data after fill people array has been gone through, re-randomize and start sequence again
- make initial start up a little smoother so there is not a blank 'person'
- add logos
- make admin
- figure out admin process for adding / removing people
- figure out server



### phase 2 ideas
- make interative to see details about the person
- special event notifications (person's birthday, office events, work anniversary)
- package up on rasberr
- search
- user controls to start stop video
